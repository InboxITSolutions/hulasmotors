                        <h1>We are going green</h1>

                             Things are changing and so are conditions in our environment. We are

breathing polluted air. With Hulas electric, you could be helping in the

reduction of such harmful gasses realized in the air. Wouldn’t you simply

wish to walk around and breath clean air? You do. We all do. Time to change a

little in how we do things on a regular basis. One of them is commuting

without really affecting the environment. Take this step. Be different. Be

unique. Make a statement. You are just there with Hulas Electric.

going green but also being a true Nepali. Let’s build a new identity.

                        <h1>It’s cool inside</h1>

international break through the comfort of Hulas Electric. It’s something

worth a consideration.
